# Introduction

Hello! My name is Sichen.

I'm a data scientist with a passion for analyzing and interpreting data to gain valuable insights. I have experience in various domains, including machine learning, data visualization, and statistical analysis.

In my journey as a data scientist, I have worked with several programming languages, such as Python and R, to manipulate and analyze data. I enjoy exploring datasets, applying statistical models, and creating visualizations to communicate findings effectively.

I'm excited to be a part of this project and collaborate with other data professionals. Let's leverage our collective expertise to tackle challenging problems and drive meaningful results.

Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or if there's anything I can assist you with!

Happy data exploring!

## Arithmetic Expressions

1. Addition: `2 + 3 = 5`
2. Subtraction: `10 - 5 = 5`
3. Multiplication: `4 * 6 = 24`
4. Division: `12 / 3 = 4`

 ## Multiplication and Addition


- Multiplication: 
  - `2 * 3 = 6`
  - `4.5 * 2 = 9`

- Addition:
  - `5 + 3 = 8`
  - `7.2 + 4.8 = 12`
 
  - hours = 180 / 60
 
= 3
